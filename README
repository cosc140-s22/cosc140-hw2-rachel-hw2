# COSC140 homework 2

## Homework feedback

 * How long did you spend on this homework?
  A realllllyyy long time. Multiple hours over multiple days. Like at least three days. It probably would have been way easier to solve the first problem by converting it all to seconds, but oh well. 

 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?
  I thought the turtle one was definitely fun, and you get to watch it draw your picture right in front of your eyes. I would personally just like some more examples to test our program in the future on other hws and labs, as I kept running into different issues and I would have to do a lot of math to figure out what the right answers were. Thank you for all of your help though!
